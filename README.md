# 👋 Hi, I’m Oshan Maharjan

💡 I’m passionate about solving the age-old economic dilemma — **"unlimited wants with limited resources"** — by leveraging the **comparative advantage of technology** to address real-world economic and social challenges.

🚀 Currently working as a **Full-Stack Developer** at **Argus Tech Corporation**, where I'm building a mobile app that empowers investors through smart, AI-powered tools that cut through information overload.

🏀💻📈 **Fun fact**: I used to wake up at 4 AM in Nepal just to watch NBA playoff games live. My top three passions? **Basketball, tech, and economics** — always in that order.
